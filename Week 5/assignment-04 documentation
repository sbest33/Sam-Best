# Week 5 Assignment Documentation

At first I had was having a really hard time understanding what was happening,
even with the example we were given for two reasons:
  - At first the use of the variables i and j were really confusing me because I
  was wondering if they had anything to do with x and y the same way they do in
  a vectorial sense, but they are just variables related to how many characters
  to display in a string.
  - I did not understand the order of operations that happen in a for loop, but
  I got a better grasp for it here:
  <https://beginnersbook.com/2014/01/c-for-loop/>.

Once I understood those two things I knew that to complete the task at hand, I
would have to change one of the variables in the code. At first I tried substituting
the 0 in the nested _for_ loop for an i, but that gave me the opposite effect of
what I wanted, because what was happening was that the nested _for_ loop would
run 10 times, therefore printing "#" 10 times, and then jump to the next line,
but this time the amount of times it would print "#" would be one time less
because our variable j would be starting at a higher number.

I then came to the conclusion that I needed to make sure that "j" started at 0
every time the master _for_ function ran, and then compare our variable "j" to
the variable "i", so that the amount of "#"'s it would run would keep increasing
every line.
