# Final Project Proposal
## What is the Project?
My project is an **Effect Switching System for a Guitar Pedalboard**. Basically what this means is that I will build a device that can recall multiple configurations of effect pedal routings, where each configuration will be triggered by its own foot-switch.

So why would this be useful? Well let's say a guitarist is playing a song that has a Verse with which requires a clean tone with some reverb, chorus, and long delay, but then the Chorus which comes right after it requires a heavy distorted tone, with no reverb, delay or chorus. In this situation, the guitarist needs to turn off three effect pedals, possibly switch pickups and hit the downbeat of the Chorus smoothly and while keeping good time, in the space of one beat. As you can imagine this is very hard to do, and leaves a lot of margin for error. With my device, all the effect switching could be done with one button press.

With the system I am proposing to build, it would only take one button press to turn on or off any number of effects that are in a pedalboard configuration of up to 8 pedals, and there would be 3 banks of 4 pedal configurations, with each pedal configuration within each bank to have it's own foot-switch to control it.

## Where to start?
At first this seemed like quite an overwhelming project, but after a lot of research I am starting to feel confident that I will be able to pull it off. Thankfully my girlfriend, Rachel, is a product engineer with a lot of experience as a thinker, and has offered to help me if I am to get stuck or hit a dead end. On top of that her brother is an Electric Engineer who has served as a great resource just for me to check if the things I am thinking of making are indeed possible and will, theoretically, work. Thankfully so far I have not hit any kind of dead end, but all the help that I have needed will be mentioned later on.

The first resource I used, was a Youtube video build demonstration of a very similar project that user [Paul Graham](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrw0n8YMvLIxB3unvbfISsw) made. I went all over the place afterwards looking for ideas, but I ended up going back to this video to use as a base for my project. He based his project off of an Arduino Mega 2560, which I will talk about more in the future, but after some research this seemed like the best method to be able to control multiple signals and to set up a system that could memorize different banks of effect configurations (I will discuss later on why I came to this conclusion).

### Understanding the analog version
I thought it would be a very good and crucial exercise for me to understand how the same kind of project can be done in analog fashion, using only electronic components, so I could then understand and appreciate how it could be recreated with the use of digital components as well. When we had previously conversed about the creation of this project, you pointed me to [this forum](https://www.harmonycentral.com/forums/topic/118660-building-an-effect-switching-system/) which was very useful in understanding the way signal can be routed in a pedalboard through electronic manipulation, especially because on this forum page I found [this page](http://www.geofex.com/article_folders/fxswitchr/fxswitchr.htm) which was crucial for me to understand an analog version of how this could be created.

I will now do my best to explain how this can be made using only analog components, and why I decided to use a digital micro-controller such as the Arduino to complete the project rather than make it all in Analog form.
