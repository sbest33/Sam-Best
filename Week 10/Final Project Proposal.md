# Final Project Proposal
## What is the Project?
My project is an Effect Switching System for a Guitar Pedalboard. Basically what this means is that I will build a device that can recall multiple configurations of effect pedal routings, where each configuration will be triggered by its own foot-switch.

So why would this be useful? Well let's say a guitarist is playing a song that has a Verse with which requires a clean tone with some reverb, chorus, and long delay, but then the Chorus which comes right after it requires a heavy distorted tone, with no reverb, delay or chorus. In this situation, the guitarist needs to turn off three effect pedals, possibly switch pickups and hit the downbeat of the Chorus smoothly and while keeping good time, in the space of one beat. As you can imagine this is very hard to do, and leaves a lot of margin for error. With my device, all the effect switching could be done with one button press.

With the system I am proposing to build, it would only take one button press to turn on or off any number of effects that are in a pedalboard configuration of up to 8 pedals, and there would be 3 banks of 4 pedal configurations, with each pedal configuration within each bank to have it's own foot-switch to control it.
